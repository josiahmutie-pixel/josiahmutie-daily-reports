        ">    **Summary:** As soon as we have *data types*, we need *variables* to store the data. In reality, Python does not offer the concept of a variable, but rather that of an *object reference*. As long as the object is immutable (like integers, floats, etc.), there is no significant difference. In this notebook, we discuss the main points surrounding the use of variables in Python.\n",

        "In Python, a variable is a fundamental programming construct that facilitates the storage and management of information in the computer's memory. It is assigned a symbolic name, which serves as a reference to the data stored at a particular location in memory. This symbolic name enables you to access and modify the stored information throughout your code with ease.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables in Python are defined using the assignment operator =. You can assign a value to a variable directly or assign the value from another variable, making Python flexible in how it handles data. Rather than containing the data themselves, variables in Python act as references to objects in memory. This reference-based approach allows for efficient memory management and provides the flexibility to interact with and modify the data dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's dynamic typing system means that variables can be reassigned to different types of data during program execution. This dynamic nature, combined with the reference model, enhances the language's capability to handle various data types and operations seamlessly. Additionally, Python's garbage collection system manages memory allocation and deallocation, further optimizing performance and resource utilization."

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Assignment from Expressions**: Variables can be defined based on expressions involving other variables. This method allows you to create variables that represent calculations or transformations of existing variables.\n",

        "### 2.4. Dynamic Typing in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at runtime rather than at compile time. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. Instead, the type is inferred based on the value assigned to the variable. This allows for more flexibility but also requires careful handling to avoid type-related errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Characteristics of Dynamic Typing:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **No Type Declaration**: You simply assign a value to a variable, and Python automatically knows what type it is.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    x = 10        # x is an integer\n",
        "    x = \"hello\"   # Now, x is a string\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "- **Type Flexibility**: The type of a variable can change over its lifetime. You can reassign a variable to a value of a different type without any issues.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    y = 3.14      # y is initially a float\n",
        "    y = True      # Now, y is a boolean\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "- **Memory Management**: Python handles memory management automatically. When you reassign a variable to a new value, the previous value is discarded if it’s no longer referenced elsewhere in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Pros and Cons of Dynamic Typing:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pros**:\n",
        "  - **Flexibility**: You can write more general-purpose code since the type is not fixed.\n",
        "  - **Ease of Use**: Less boilerplate code, as there is no need for explicit type declarations.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Cons**:\n",
        "  - **Type-Related Errors**: Since types are determined at runtime, it’s possible to encounter errors if the wrong type is used in an operation.\n",
        "  - **Performance**: Dynamic typing can be slower than static typing because type checks are done at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Initially, 'data' is an integer\n",
        "data = 100\n",
        "\n",

        "**Coercion** in Python refers to the automatic conversion of one data type to another during operations that involve different types. Python is designed to handle these type conversions in a way that makes the language easier to use and reduces the need for manual type casting.\n",

        "#### Key Points About Coercion:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Implicit Coercion**: Python automatically converts one data type to another when necessary to perform an operation. This usually happens in arithmetic operations involving different types, like an integer and a float.\n",
        "  - For example, if you add an integer to a float, Python will convert the integer to a float before performing the addition.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Explicit Coercion**: While Python handles many conversions automatically, you can also manually convert types using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc. This is known as explicit type casting."
